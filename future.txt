This is future
The year is 2285
Everyone is getting high
Itâ€™s all about high profile
To live is to die
No more prison and trial
A free world to compile
All your sins will fly

The judgment is yours to consider
Money for nothing to ponder
Distance yourself further
No retreat and no surrender
The going will get wilder
The tough will get weaker
The ozone layer became thinner
